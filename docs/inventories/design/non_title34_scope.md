# Non-Title 34, Non-HEA Regulatory Universe (Scope Stub)

This document defines the universe for "Bucket 2a": non-HEA federal regulations that
impose incremental burden on institutions of higher education beyond what a typical
employer would face.

## Initial families (A–G in scope)

- A. Civil rights & nondiscrimination regimes (non-HEA)
- B. Student-facing safety, crime, and harassment regimes (non-HEA)
- C. Disability, access, and accommodation (beyond standard employment law)
- D. Research, grants, and sponsored programs
- E. Privacy, data security, and records
- F. Employment & workforce-related requirements that are IHE-specific
- G. Other IHE-specific regimes (e.g., special grant programs, education-specific rules)

## Next actions

- Define target Titles/parts for each family.
- Prioritize which families to scope first for IHE-only burden.
- Stand up parent-level scoping tables under `data/non_title34/`.
